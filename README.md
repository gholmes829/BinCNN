# BinCNN
Perform tasks with binary convolutional neural networks! Currently under development...

## Get started:
* Download Python 3.8+ `https://www.python.org/downloads/`
* Clone repository `git clone https://github.com/gholmes829/BinCNN.git`
* Install dependencies `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run with `python3 <desired script>`

_Note: Windows users may need to run commands with `python` instead of `python3`_
